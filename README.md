###My name is Samuel McLaughlin, and I am currently an intern in the CMS CyberVets cyber security program. Prior to starting this internship, I was active-duty military in the Marine Corps as a Cryptologic Language Analyst working for the National Security Agency in Fort Meade, MD. The CyberVets program is a 6-month cyber security internship run through the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) revolving around training prior military members into cyber security machines. The program starts off with areas of focus such as network fundamentals, network forensics, and network operations, and evolves into harder topics such as reverse engineering, Linux, windows, and android exploitation, threat management, and malware repurposing.
